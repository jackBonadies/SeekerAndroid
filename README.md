Seeker is a [Soulseek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulseek) client for Android written in C# (with Xamarin) supporting downloading, searching, sharing, messages, chatrooms, port forwarding, and more.

This work uses the [Soulseek.NET](https://github.com/jpdillingham/Soulseek.NET) library for communicating with Soulseek server and network peers.  It also references the unofficial [Soulseek Protocol Documentation](https://nicotine-plus.github.io/nicotine-plus/doc/SLSKPROTOCOL.html) implemented by the developers of the [Nicotine+](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus) client.
