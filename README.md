A [soulseek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulseek) client for Android written in C# (with Xamarin) supporting downloading, searching, sharing, messages, chatrooms, port forwarding, and more.

This work uses the [Soulseek.NET](https://github.com/jpdillingham/Soulseek.NET) library for communicating with Soulseek server and peers.  It also references the unofficial protocol documentation here [nicotine protocol documentation](https://nicotine-plus.github.io/nicotine-plus/doc/SLSKPROTOCOL.html).

The Soulseek server, which makes this app possible, relies on donations. Donate here: [Donate](https://www.slsknet.org/donate.php).

This app will always be completely free, no ads, no 'premium' versions or paid features, etc.
